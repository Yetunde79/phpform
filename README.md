# phpform

Form that sends email with php

How I hosted the website on heroku

Installed composer and heroku.

How to set up composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

sent php doc to heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php

Set up sendgrid: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sendgrid

*Don't forget to create API key

Might go to spam since we can't verify domain name through heroku. Just remove the spam label from email

If we are using a regular hoster like AWS or Godaddy, we can verify by going to our sendgrid account, settings, then senders authentication. Click Authenticate your Domain and follow the steps
